# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The R run_analysis.R code presented in this repository performs the following:

download the dataset from the url link https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
load the data from the test and and training sets.
merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
from the previously data set, creates a second one, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
